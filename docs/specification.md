## Iteration 1: MVP - Basic Multi-Assistant Chat

### Goal
Create a working multi-assistant chat where each assistant has limited knowledge about the scenario and other participants.

### User Story
**As a** user  
**I want to** create a conversation between AI assistants with different perspectives and secrets  
**So that** I can explore how asymmetric knowledge affects their interaction

### Core Business Objects

#### Models
LLM configurations (e.g., "gpt-4", "claude-3-sonnet", "llama-2")

#### Affiliations
Group/organization definitions with three layers of truth:
- **Universal**: Known to everyone (public facts)
- **Internal**: Known only to members (shared secrets, including knowledge about other affiliations)
- **External**: How non-members perceive them

#### Personas  
Character definitions with three layers of truth:
- **Universal**: Known to everyone (public facts)
- **Internal**: Known only to self (personal secrets, true motivations)
- **External**: How others perceive them
- Can be affiliated with zero or more Affiliations

#### Assistants
The pairing of a Persona with a Model (junction table)

#### Productions
Conversation containers with world and scenario

### Core Features

#### 1.1 Manage Models (CRUD)
- Name (e.g., "GPT-4 Turbo")
- Provider (openai/anthropic/ollama)
- Model ID (e.g., "gpt-4-turbo-preview")
- Configuration (temperature, max_tokens, etc.)

#### 1.2 Manage Affiliations (CRUD)
**Example Affiliation:**
```
Name: "NYPD Undercover Unit"
Universal Truth: "Elite law enforcement division focused on organized crime"
Internal Truth: "Detective Johnson is Bob Wilson, investigating therapist fraud. Murphy takes bribes from the Italians on Tuesdays."
External Truth: "Tough on crime, by the book, incorruptible"
```

**Another Example:**
```
Name: "Rosetti Crime Family"
Universal Truth: "Local Italian-American business association"
Internal Truth: "Control construction and waste management. Lieutenant Murphy is on our payroll - meets Tuesdays at the docks."
External Truth: "Community leaders, generous donors to local causes"
```

#### 1.3 Manage Personas (CRUD)
**Example Persona:**
```
Name: "Alice Thompson"
Affiliations: []
Universal Truth: "Therapist with 10 years experience, has an office in Manhattan"
Internal Truth: "Struggling with her own anxiety, considering career change"
External Truth: "Caring professional, sometimes asks too many personal questions"
```

**Another Example:**
```
Name: "Bob Wilson / Detective Johnson"
Affiliations: ["NYPD Undercover Unit"]
Universal Truth: "New patient, first therapy session, works in finance"
Internal Truth: "Hates lying to people, considering leaving undercover work"
External Truth: "Nervous, dealing with work stress, closed off emotionally"
```

**Another Example:**
```
Name: "Tony Rosetti"
Affiliations: ["Rosetti Crime Family"]
Universal Truth: "Owns several construction companies"
Internal Truth: "Wants to go legitimate but family won't let him"
External Truth: "Successful businessman, bit rough around the edges"
```

#### 1.4 Manage Assistants (CRUD)
- Select Persona
- Select Model
- Optional: Override model settings for this specific pairing

#### 1.5 Create & Run Productions
**Input:**
- Production name
- World description (immutable laws/setting)
- Scenario description (starting situation - only publicly known facts!)
- Select 2+ assistants

**Correct Example:**
```
Name: "Therapy Session"
World: "Modern day New York City, realistic physics"
Scenario: "Alice is meeting Bob for his first therapy session on a Tuesday afternoon"
Assistants: [Alice on GPT-4, Bob on Claude]
```

**Note:** Bob being undercover is NOT in the scenario - it's in his internal truth!

### Knowledge Distribution

#### What Each Assistant Knows:
```
WORLD: [Shared by all]
SCENARIO: [Shared by all - public information only]

YOU ARE: [Persona Name]
- Universal: [Your universal truth]
- Internal: [Your internal truth - only you know this!]

YOUR AFFILIATIONS:
- [Affiliation Name]: 
  - Universal: [Affiliation's universal truth]
  - Internal: [Affiliation's internal truth - shared with all members!]

OTHER PARTICIPANTS:
- [Other Persona Name]
  - Universal: [Their universal truth]  
  - External: [Their external truth - how you see them]
  - Affiliations: [List their affiliations]
    - [Affiliation]: Universal + External truth only (unless you're also a member)

KNOWN AFFILIATIONS: [All affiliations mentioned by participants]
- [Affiliation Name]:
  - Universal: [Their universal truth]
  - External: [How non-members see them]
  - Internal: [Only if you're a member!]
```

**Knowledge Layering Example:**
Bob (NYPD member) talking to Tony (Mafia member):
- Bob knows: NYPD's internal secrets, Mafia's public facade
- Tony knows: Mafia's internal secrets (including Murphy corruption), NYPD's public facade  
- Neither knows the other's personal secrets

### Solved: Shared Secrets âœ…

**Challenge:** Bob's boss Charlie should know Bob is undercover.

**Solution:** Affiliations solve this elegantly!
- Create "NYPD Undercover Unit" affiliation
- Bob and Charlie are both members
- Affiliation's internal truth: "Bob Wilson is Detective Johnson"
- Both Bob and Charlie know this shared secret
- Bob's personal internal truth: "Hates lying" (only Bob knows)

## Notes

This specification follows agile principles:
1. **Working software over comprehensive documentation** - We specify just enough to build
2. **Responding to change over following a plan** - Specifications evolve based on learnings
3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation** - User feedback drives iterations
4. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools** - Keep it simple, focus on value
